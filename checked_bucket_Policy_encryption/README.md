## Write a script that checks all the S3 buckets and identifies which are not encrypted and have no bucket policy applied.

<h6> Key terms </h6>

* **S3 Encryption**
  - All new objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket are automatically encrypted at rest. Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) is the default encryption configuration for  buckets in Amazon  Simple Storage Service (S3).


* **Bucket Policy**

  - It secures access to objects in your buckets, so that only users with the appropriate permissions can access them. You can also prevent authenticated users without the appropriate permissions from accessing your Amazon S3 resources.
